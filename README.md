## Deployment

ServoBot is built as a webserver that connects with the Twitch and Discord APIs to be able to monitor chats.
The service must be backed by a MySQL database. This server can be run on an online hosting platform such as Amazon AWS.

These are the detailed instructions on how to deploy it to AWS.

### Reserve an amazon EC2 instance  

For the most part follow the steps in this [guide](https://www.guru99.com/creating-amazon-ec2-instance.html)

1. For the AMI, select `Amazon Linux 2 AMI`
1. The instance type can be a micro, such as t2.micro for the free tier.
  The MoosersBot instance is using t3.micro because at the time of reserving it was a tad cheaper.
1. Instance details should be as follows
    * Number of Instances: 1
    * Request Spot Instances: Check (This can be no, but spot instances tend to be cheaper though may get taken down
    during high load times.)
    * Maximum Price: About twice what the current price is.
    * Credit specification, unlimited: Uncheck (I'm not sure if this will come up, but unchecking to make sure an
    errant server won't spend all my money)
1. Add a tag with the key `Name` and value to reflect the name of the instance.
1. For the security group configuration
    * Rename the security group as you see fit
    * There should be an SSH port for logging into the instance remotely.
    I typically set it for `My IP` to limit who can connect remotely.
    * There needs to be a port for serving the web pages to everyone.
    The server is currently configured to serve on port 5000. 
1. Launching the instance will create a Key needed to access it.
   Download the private key (.pem file) and keep it in a secure location.
        
### Configure the instance
    
To connect to the instance, follow the instructions in this [guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/putty.html)

1. Update dependencies
    ```sh
    sudo yum update
    ```
2. Install java
    `sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk`
3. Enable the ServoBot service ðŸš§ *Still working on this step* ðŸš§
    1. Upload the service file and jar
    1. Make the appropriate directories
    1. Copy the service file to the right location
    1. Figure out logging
    1. start the service

### Deploy a new version
