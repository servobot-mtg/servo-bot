        <h2>Bot Concepts</h2>
        <h3>Commands</h3>
        <p class="content">Most of the ways the bot interacts is through commands. While the bot is active it,
            constantly listens to the Twitch chat. Whenever someone in chat types the name of a command, Servobot will
            respond by following the command instructions. ServoBot has a wide away of command types which determine
            how it responds.</p>
        <p class="content">Many commands can be configured through Twitch chat itself and there is a rich
            syntax for declaring and configuring commands. However some commands must be configured through the ServoBot
            webpage for a channel. See the command <a href="help/commands">help page</a> for more details.
        </p>

        <h3>User Levels</h3>
        <p class="content">ServoBot has a notion of user levels. Within a given channel, each user is at one of these
            levels and the level controls what commands that user may access. Each user at may access any command that
            has its permissions level set to a level at or below that of the user.</p>
        <div class="content">
            <table class="data-table">
                <thead><tr>
                    <th>Level</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                </tr></thead>
                <tr>
                    <td>Admin</td>
                    <td>A member of the bot administration team. These special users have bot access on any channel that
                        the bot is in.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Streamer</td>
                    <td>The user of the Twitch channel. The streamer has ultimate power within their channel.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Moderator</td>
                    <td>A moderator of the Twitch channel. These users usually have much control over the bot within a
                        channel and usually act on behalf of the streamer.<br>
                        ServoBot recognizes users that the streamer has given Twitch moderator privileges and treats
                        them as such for purposes of the bot.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Sub</td>
                    <td>A subscriber of the Twitch channel. These users sometimes get special access to commands.<br>
                        ServoBot recognizes users that have subscribed on Twitch automatically once they have chatted in
                        the Twitch channel.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Anyone</td>
                    <td>This user level is a catch all for everyone else. This is the user level for commands that
                        anyone may trigger.</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </div>

        <h3>Alerts</h3>
        <p class="content">ServoBot has the ability to define when alerts happen. An alert is an event that can trigger
            commands. Alerts can be set up to happen at a repeating interval or at a certain time each day.</p>
        <p>It is possible to make a command, called the Delayed Alert Command, which will trigger an alert after a
            specified time. For example a command that is triggered when the stream starts can cause a delayed trigger
            to happen 30 minutes into the stream.</p>

        <h3>Books</h3>
        <p class="content">ServoBot has a concept which it calls a book. A book is a list of statements. The most common
            reason to have a book is to make commands which will give a response that varies each time. For example, a
            book may contain several statements which are each interesting facts about a given subject. Then a command
            called !facts can be used to respond with a random statement from that book.</p>
        <p class="content">A Book also provides a way for alerts to give a variety of messages. Just create a book that
            contains all the messages that you want the alert to provide, set up the timing of the alert, and then make
            a command that triggers off the alert and responds with the book's variable.<p>

        <h3>Variables</h3>
        <p class="content">In some contexts, ServoBot has the ability to change the text it uses dynamically. It
            determines, or can be programmed with, the the knowledge of certain variables. The variables come in four
            flavors: pre-defined, based on context, channel-defined, and books.<p>
        <p class="content">Pre-defined variables are set on the bot and can be used almost anywhere the bot allows text.
            For example %time% will be replaced with the current time. A full list of these variables is on the variable
            <a href="help/variables">help page</a>.<p>
        <p class="content">Context variables may be supplied depending on the context that the text appears. For example
            %sender% will be replaced with the username of whomever triggered a command in chat, but will not be
            replaced if the command was triggered by a timed alert. A full list of these variables is on the variable
            <a href="help/variables">help page</a>.<p>
        <p class="content">Channel-defined variables can be set by the streamer by using the set value command or
            through the ServoBot website.<p>
        <p class="content">Book-defined variables are set by the presence of a book. The book's name is the variable and
            the value is one of the book's statement, determined at random.<p>

        <h3>Expressions</h3>
        <p class="content">Most of the time the expressions used in commands will be just the names of variables.
            However, anywhere a variable can be used, ServoBot is capable of more complex calculations.</p>
        <p class="content">For numerical values, ServoBot can perform simple
            mathematical computations: addition +, subtraction -, multiplication *. Also parentheses can be used to
            change the order of operations.<p>
        <p class="content">For string values, + is the concatenation operation, which just combines the two string
            values one after another.<p>
        <p class="content">For string values, + is the concatenation operation, which just combines the two string
            values one after another.<p>
        <p class="content">Additionally there is the conditional operator: A ? B : C. The expression A is evaluated and
            if it results in a true value (or non empty string), then the result of the expression is B's value.
            Otherwise the result is C's. For example, a common idiom is : "%input ? input : 'default text'%" to supply a
            command with default text if the command wasn't given input when triggered.<p>
